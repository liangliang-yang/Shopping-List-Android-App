* On opening the app, the user will be provided with an empty list with plus sign (if no list has been created yet). By clicking on the plus button, the user is able to add a list. The default name of the new created list is "New List". The user can also change the name by clicking on the list name in the user lists page which will lead to the edit screen. If the user wants to delete a list, user can simply swipe the list from left to right and the target list will be deleted.

* Once the user clicks on a list from the main screen, the app will take the user to a second screen which contains the details about the selected list. As you can see in the example figure above, inside the list view, items in the list are grouped and ordered by item types and item names. The user can easily check or uncheck one item, change the quantity of an item, or delete an item. Also there is an "UNCHECK ALL" button, which will allow the user to uncheck all items in a simple click. Similarly as the main screen, there is also a plus button that in the lower side of the screen, and the user can click on it if he/she wants to add an item to the list. This will take the user to the next screen.

* In the third screen, the user can search the database (there is a pre-populated database inside the app) for the required item by typing the item name or selecting an item type. Search results will returns on the user typing, and the app will search the database and return all matched results. By clicking on the search item, the user would be able to add the item to the list. If no results are returned (the item is not in the current database), the user can add the item to the database by clicking on the button "ADD AS NEW ITEM!".
* 

All changes made to the list are automatically saved as soon as the change is made.
